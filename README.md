# JavaFX-Model-View-Controller

Create	appropriate	back-end	of	application (this	is	
the	Books application	including	Book,	
yourLastNameMain,yourLastNameInvalidISBNException
program	files)	â€“ this	is	basically	the	last	version	of	the	
app,	with	the	new program	that	accomplishes:
* includes	JavaFX	libraries
* extends	Application
* includes	the	start	method for	the	UI which	also
reads	the	file	and	creates	the	ArrayList
* creates	a	ListView	and	associated	listener
* the	listener	populates	the	image	in	the	imageview
* the	listener	responds	and	populates	the	next	
image	when	a	user	clicks	on a	different	book.
